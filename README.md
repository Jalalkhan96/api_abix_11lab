## üßë‚Äçüíª Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code

### 1. **Global Styles** (`* { box-sizing: border-box; }`)
We ensure all elements have consistent box sizing across the project. The `box-sizing` property ensures that padding and borders are included in the element's total width and height, which is important for layout consistency.

### 2. **Body Styling**
We apply a **linear gradient** background with the colors `#32043a` (dark purple) and `#928DAB` (light purple). This creates a sleek, modern design for the background.

```css
body {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #32043a, #928DAB);
}
